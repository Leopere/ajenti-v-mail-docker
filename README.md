# Ajenti-V-Mail
### Scope
This docker container is built for the purpose of making an email server as properly as possible using the lasiest possible method that doesn't require a high level of insanity.  The downside to this method is there is no simple way to make yourself an email account/configuration via the command line.  There are postfix/dovecot docker containers for that and if thats what you wish to do I highly suggest you check them out!

This container is built upon Crosby Michael's python container built ontop of debian:jessie

## Usage
I might write this out one day if someone wants to make me do it by telling me to in a github issue.
